                    Hey, Iâ€™m Arjun Appukuttan, a Full Stack Developer (MERN) passionate about building scalable and efficient web applications.
                    My journey into coding started in my senior secondary days, which led me to pursue a BCA degree. During my final-year project,
                    I discovered my love for web development and later refined my skills through a MERN stack development course.
                </p>
                <p
                    className="font-genos font-normal md:text-lg text-zinc-100 drop-shadow-lg"
                >
                    I specialize in backend development, focusing on building robust APIs, database management, and optimizing server-side logic
                    using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. At the same time, I have experience with React and modern frontend technologies, ensuring
                    smooth and responsive user experiences when needed.
                </p>

                    className="font-genos font-normal md:text-lg text-zinc-100 drop-shadow-lg"
                >
                    I thrive on solving complex problems, writing clean and efficient code, and continuously learning new technologies to stay ahead
                    in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
